    <p> Captain America's shield is his first and only weapon. His shield is a disc shaped object with a star design in the center. It has a blue, red, and white circle. This shield is made of Vibranium, Steel alloy, and another unknown third component. It's indestructible. It is as much an offensive weapon as a defensive one for Captain America.</p>
